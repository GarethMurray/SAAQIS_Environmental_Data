# SAAQIS_Environmental_Data
All downloaded data from SAAQIS. 

I have written a script to download all the data from https://saaqis.environment.gov.za/ from 2005. I have placed all data from each station into its own csv file for convenience. 

Feel free to contact me for any issues, visualisations or to request udpates to the database.
